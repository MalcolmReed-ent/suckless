dmenu-4.9 - dynamic menu
====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.


Differences
-----------
I updated the 'dmenu_run' configuration to include Flatpak applications in '/var/lib' and '/.local/share' directories.
In the 'config.mk' file, I adjusted the 'CFLAGS' setting to '-O0', so it compiles faster.
I added scripts installation into the 'Makefile' to streamline the build process, so all are compiled together.


Scripts
-------
dmenu_dfm - A file manager that uses specified xdg-open applications
dmenu_search - Search the web using a chosen search engine or site
dmenu_youtube - Find and play YouTube videos via Invidious using mpv
dmenu_youtube_channels - Browse selected YouTube channels and play videos with mpv


Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for details.
