dwm-6.4 - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Differences
-----------
-In this DWM fork, I have streamlined the layouts to only include tile. I have also modified the 'Makefile' so that when you 'make install' or 'make uninstall', a dwm.desktop file will be added or removed from /usr/share/xsessions. 

-Furthermore, I built in a sh script inside the 'Cool Autostart' part of the 'config.h' to display [MPD/MPC Song | Disk | Battery | Volume | Date] so it removes the use of slstatus

-Lastly, I edited the config.mk compiler flags by using -O0 and other minimal flags so it compiles faster then the original

Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
      sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
